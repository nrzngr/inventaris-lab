## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ installed
- A Supabase account and project

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd lab-inventory-system
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up Supabase**

   a. Create a new Supabase project at [supabase.com](https://supabase.com)

   b. Run the database schema:
   ```sql
   -- Copy and execute the contents of database/schema.sql in your Supabase SQL editor
   ```

   c. Get your Supabase URL and anon key from the Supabase dashboard

4. **Environment variables**

   Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory:
   ```env
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url_here
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key_here
   DATABASE_URL=your_database_url_here
   ```

5. **Run the development server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

6. **Open your browser**

   Navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## Database Schema

The system uses the following main tables:

- `categories` - Equipment categories
- `equipment` - Laboratory equipment items
- `user_profiles` - User information and roles
- `borrowing_transactions` - Equipment borrowing records
- `maintenance_records` - Equipment maintenance logs

See `database/schema.sql` for the complete schema definition.

## User Roles
